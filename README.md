This is a project that I developed in the section 15 of Angela Yu's IOS development <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank">course</a>. I was introduced to the Table View component, being able to create custom cells with a Xib file and making my own cloud-based backend databse.
